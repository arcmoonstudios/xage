   Usage: xynpro lxsl
   Example: 
     $ cd /path/to/your/project
     $ xynpro lxsl
   
   This command will:
   - Scan all files in the current directory and subdirectories
   - Skip files that shouldn't have signatures (e.g., binaries, images)
   - Clean existing signatures from files
   - Add new signatures to appropriate files

2. Xyn Git Update (XynGit)
   Command: xyngit
   Description: Automates the process of staging, committing, and pushing changes to the git repository.

     $ cd /path/to/your/git/repo
     $ xynpro xyngit

   This command will:
   - Stage all changes in the current repository
   - Create a commit with the message "Automated update via xyngit"
   - Push the changes to the remote repository (default branch: main)

3. XynScript Management
   Description: Tools for managing your custom scripts (including pyscan and others).

   a. Backup Current Script
      Command: cat ~/.bin/<script_name> > ~/Projects/$(basename "$PWD")/xdocs/ow<script_name>
      Example: cat ~/.bin/pyscan > ~/Projects/$(basename "$PWD")/xdocs/owpyscan
      Description: Creates a tantalizing backup of your script in the xdocs/ directory of your current project.

   b. Reset Script
      Commands:
        rm ~/.bin/<script_name>
        nano ~/.bin/<script_name>
      Example:
        rm ~/.bin/pyscan
        nano ~/.bin/pyscan
      Description: Removes the current script, letting you start fresh with a clean slate. Opens nano for you to sculpt your new script to perfection.

   c. Make Script Executable
      Command: chmod +x ~/.bin/<script_name>
      Example: chmod +x ~/.bin/pyscan
      Description: Grants your script the power to execute, making it ready for action at your command.

4. PyScan Management
   Description: Tools for managing the pyscan utility.

   a. Backup Current PyScan
      Command: cat ~/.bin/pyscan > ~/Projects/$(basename "$PWD")/xdocs/owPyScan.txt
      Description: Overwrites the current pyscan in xdocs/ as owPyScan.txt, creating a tantalizing backup.

   b. Reset PyScan
      Commands:
        rm ~/.bin/pyscan
        nano ~/.bin/pyscan
      Description: Removes the current pyscan, letting you start fresh with a clean slate. Opens nano for you to sculpt your new pyscan to perfection.

   c. Make PyScan Executable
      Command: chmod +x ~/.bin/pyscan
      Description: Grants pyscan the power to execute, making it ready for action at your command.

5. Source Code Concatenation
   Command: 
   
find src/ tests/ -type f -name '*.rs' -print0 | xargs -0 awk 'FNR==1 && NR!=1 {print "\n\n"} {print}' > Xdocs/XynProCurrentState.txt
   
   Description: Combines all source files in the src/ and tests/ directories and their subdirectories into a single file.
   Usage: Run this command from the root directory of your project.
   Example:
     $ cd /path/to/your/project
     $ find src/ tests/ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 cat > Xdocs/XynProCurrentState.txt

   This command will:
   - Find all files in the src/ and tests/ directories and their subdirectories
   - Concatenate the contents of all these files
   - Output the result to Xdocs/XynProCurrentState.txt in your current working directory

Note: LXSL, XynGit, and Source Code Concatenation commands should be run from the root directory of your project or git repository. Script management commands can be run from any directory, but be mindful of your current location when backing up.

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use these commands wisely, and may your code always bear the mark of Lord Xyn!

Pro Tip: Regular use of pyscan may lead to increased productivity and an irresistible urge to optimize everything. Use with caution - you might find yourself addicted to its efficiency!
