# 🚀 XAGE 🦀

    xage is a Rust project created by XynPro.

## ✨ Features

- 📁 Creates a standardized Rust project structure
- 🎨 Adds custom headers to Rust files (.rs)
- 📜 Generates a LICENSE file with MIT License
- 📚 Creates a README.md with project information and acknowledgements
- 🐙 Initializes a Git repository
- 📦 Sets up a Cargo.toml with predefined dependencies

## 🛠️ Usage

To unleash the power of this project, run the following command in your terminal:

XynPro Instructions:

Update your src/main.rs file with this new code.
Rebuild your project:
```
cargo build --release
```
Copy the new binary to your ~/.cargo/bin directory:
```
cp ./target/release/xynpro ~/.cargo/bin/xynpro
```
Make sure the binary is executable:
```
chmod +x ~/.cargo/bin/xynpro
```
Test the new functionality:
a. Check the version:
```
xynpro --version
```
This should output: "xynpro version 0.0.7"
b. Create a new project:
```
xynpro my_new_project
```
This should create a new project structure in a directory called "my_new_project"
If you encounter any issues, check the error messages and ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
If everything works as expected, you can now use this updated version of xynpro to create projects and check its version.

Remember, if you need to make any further changes, you'll need to repeat steps 2-4 to rebuild and update the executable.
